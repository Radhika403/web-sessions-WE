                <p>Arctic Monkeys are an English rock band formed in Sheffield in 2002. The group consists of lead
                    singer Alex
                    Turner, drummer Matt Helders, guitarist Jamie Cook and bassist Nick O'Malley.
                    Former bassist Andy Nicholson left the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was released. In
                    the United
                    Kingdom, the band became the first independent-label band to debut at number one in the UK with
                    their
                    first five albums.</p>

                    band began to grow in popularity across the north of England, receiving attention from BBC Radio and
                    the British
                    tabloid press. Eventually, they were signed to Domino in June 2005.</p>

            <h1 class="rubrik-heading"> Musical Style and Influence </h1>
            <p> Arctic Monkeys' musical style has been mainly described as indie rock, garage rock, post-punk revival,
                psychedelic
                rock, alternative rock, lounge pop,
                post-Britpop, stoner rock, guitar pop, post-punk, punk rock, and hard rock.</p>
            <p>According to Vice, in Britain at least, Arctic Monkeys have reached a point where they are "too enormous,
                too beloved
                a
                force to truly fail" and are probably the UK's biggest, most culturally important band. Vice further
                states that
                they
                are the band whose music taste can otherwise be described as "Match of the Day-wave". English poet
                John Cooper Clarke praised the band as "the nearest thing" to the Beatles. Radio X has also named Arctic
                Monkeys as
                one of the best bands of all time.</p>
